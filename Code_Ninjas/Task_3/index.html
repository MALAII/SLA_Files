                <p>"Fall" (2022) is a survival thriller about two best friends, Becky and Hunter, who climb a 2,000-foot abandoned radio tower for fun, but find themselves stranded at the top with no way down. The film follows their struggle to survive against the elements, limited supplies, and the sheer terror of their situation. </p>
                <h3 style="color: white;">PLOT </h3>
                <p>
Becky, her husband Dan, and their friend Hunter are rock climbing when Dan loses his footing and falls to his death. A year later, Becky has become reclusive and withdrawn, struggling with grief and contemplating suicide. She has also become estranged from her father, who believes Dan would not have mourned her in the same way. On the anniversary of Dan's death, Hunter invites Becky to climb the decommissioned 2,000-foot (610 m) B-67 TV tower in the desert. Hunter suggests scattering Dan’s ashes from the top as a form of closure. Though hesitant, Becky agrees.

After reaching the base, the two ascend via a series of rusted ladders to a small platform at the summit. There, Hunter encourages Becky to briefly free-hang from the platform while recording the moment for social media. Becky scatters Dan’s ashes, and they begin their descent—but a ladder segment breaks off, leaving them stranded at the top with no way down. Becky is slightly injured in the fall, and their backpack, containing water and a drone, lands on a satellite dish far below.

With no cellular signal due to interference from the tower’s communications equipment, the pair attempt various methods to attract help. Hunter places her phone in a shoe and drops it beyond the interference range, but it fails to result in rescue. They later spot two men with a dog nearby and signal them with a flare gun, but the men steal their car instead. Becky then discovers a tattoo on Hunter's ankle with the numbers "1-4-3," a code Dan used to say "I love you." Hunter admits to having had an affair with Dan before Becky’s wedding.

The next day, Hunter climbs down using their rope to retrieve the backpack. Though injured, she succeeds in tying the bag to the rope, and Becky hauls it back up. Becky later experiences a hallucination of a vulture attacking Hunter’s corpse, which prompts her to realize that Hunter died during the descent and that she has been imagining her presence ever since.

With power drawn from a warning light on the tower, Becky recharges the drone and sends it toward a nearby motel with a written message. The drone is struck by a truck and destroyed. As Becky grows weaker from dehydration, a vulture attacks her wounded leg. She kills it and consumes part of it for nourishment. Regaining strength, Becky descends to Hunter’s body, hides a phone with a text message to her father inside Hunter’s shoe, and pushes the body along with the shoe off the tower. The message is transmitted upon impact.

Rescue personnel are alerted and arrive shortly after. Becky is saved and reunites with her father.</p>
