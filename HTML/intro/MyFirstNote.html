    <p> Hi everyone ! Iam Malaiyarasi from vellore Now currently residing in KK nagar.</p>
    <p>I completed my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from Kingston Engineering College, located in vellore. Driven by a strong passion for emerging technologies, I have always been eager to explore the ever-evolving field of full stack development and consistently work on enhancing my skill set.
My technical journey began with a deep curiosity about how websites function behind the scenes how creative designs are brought to life and how data flows seamlessly between the front-end and back-end. This fascination led me to enroll in a full stack development course at SLA.

      I love to watch movies in free time my favourite genre of movies is crime thriller and pyscho thriller movies and also love to watch twisted movies.
      then I like to cook spicy food items and started doing it with the personal interest during my free time and holidays.
      My favourite thing to say is hanging out with friends and dancing , not a professional dancer but i love to dance.

    <p>One of my best travel memories is my college industrial visit (IV) to Kerala a two-day trip filled with fun and adventure. I had an amazing time exploring many beautiful spots across Kerala with my friends. What made it even more special was that we celebrated our farewell during the trip, making it both overwhelming and emotional. It’s a memory I’ll always cherish. </p>
