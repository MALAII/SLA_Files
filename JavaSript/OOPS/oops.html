<!-- OOPS:
----
Object Oriented Programming Language
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing programs using objects that hold both 
information and actions, making it easier to organize and manage the code.

OOPS PRINCIPLES:
----------------
CLASS:
------
class means it is the internal datamodel references of  itself.
The class defines its own data structure (like fields or properties).

It knows how to create objects (instances) with that structure.

Each object created from the class will refer to this structure â€” its own internal model.
A blueprint for creating objects.

RULES FOR CLASS:
----------------
class keyword must be there
 following to that class name must be in capitalize.
for one class we can able to call multiple ojects.


OBJECTS:
-------
An object means reference of the class
create an object inside a class
var classnew = new objectname
An instance of a class.


new keyword - instance of object -for immediate calling
this keyword - represents of the owner of the object
constructor function - is the default function
which always represents the object.

both classes and objects are dependent on each other.

3. Data encapsulation
4. Data abstraction
5. Inheritance
6. Polymorphism -->
